plan:
    //PHASE 1

    .contact the guy from discord and try and ask him for ways to shrink the size of the sidebar in order to be friendly to mobile users (which will help you eventually to transform your website to a mobile app really easy)

    .find the colorlib jobs-board template and copy the jobs-list from their template and try and fit it into your "Browse for courses" page //failed

    .use bootstrap pagination into your site

    .Search for a video player to make Live sessions later be available as recorded videos(either upl;oaded by teachers or automatically by the system), also search for a live video plugin like Zoom, Jitsi etc.

    .try not and invest alot of time automating tasks that can already be made manually, we law ya seedy 3la en om el modareseen mesh hayefhamo, e3mlohom tutorials ha! 

    .setup the following pages (Assignments, Quizzes, My Books, Upcoming sessions) to not do any more frontend while working on the backend.s

    .wake up really early, work for a lot of time, take short breaks, try and eat healthily, workout with the dumbelles for 1 hour straight per day.

    .make sure your pace is higher in order to finish the backend in a really fast way

    .try and add a feature that is new to the e-learning systems, also add the features from the student-management systems on youtube (BS 3ALY OM EL PACE)

    .You need to finish this site completely before 1/10/2020, dont focus to much on the front-end, lesa odamak back-end we hosting, we server setup we enak asln t3mlo publishing we beta-testing, we leela kebeera awy s3atak. + odamak 26 days, and still counting

    .Don't focus to much on detail, DONE is better than PERFECT

    //PHASE 2

    .when published, you should be at school already, if so, then try and hire 2 or more people to manage the social media pages for wablo, let them try and gather info from users on the application, you may even want to add some pop-ups at the end of each offline session to let the users giv you their ratings (who knows ya 3m), also you are up for alot of javascript.

    .if the users ratings are bad, then try and reach out to them (try and diffrentiate between real pure-new users, and your friends(btoo3 el tatbeel), and your enemies).

    .DO NOT UPGRADE YOUR WEBSITE UNTIL PHASE 3, IN PHASE 2 ENTA TERAKEZ FI OM EL DERASA WE TEGAMA3 INFORMATION MEN EL NAS BAS

    .there are alot of mobile users, you personally were one of them, people care more about their phones more than laptops, so try and fix that. so either find and fit the time to create an application for android mobile users (since IOS users can already purchase a laptop)

    #IF IT ALL FAILS

    .then just create the app, the good enough website, and see your friend's reactions (which should be a 100% honest reaction) and rate it, it should pretty much sum it up to you how it would look if you already published it with all these problems. 

    .In school weekends, try and fix each and every bug (the amount of bugs you fix is really dependent on how big and hard those bugs can be)

    .then just focus a bit about school, this is the most important year, just focus a bit, the website will eventually be published, just wait.

    .and finally, when it is done, when you solve all it's problems, and make sure you check all PHASE 1's tasks. Then publish it , and start from PHASE 2.
