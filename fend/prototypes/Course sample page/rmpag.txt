plan: 
    (all pages should be done within one week)
    .make 2 pages per day (should take 8 days)
    #also try to finish all in one week 


lastly:
    After finishing all the remaining pages, make sure to join all pages together as a site demo.
    Then construct the django project with all the apps and the staticfiles.
    And after debugging, make sure to write the documentation for your code.
    and hit publish site. (these notes are not final, make sure to recheck them while being in the process of the django code)
